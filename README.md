# Machine-Learning
On Pluralsight there is a machine-learning course called "How Machine Learning Works."
This course gives an introduction into machine learning in python.
In my code here I have implemented this courses material into C++.

There are 2 files, single variable and multiple variable. 
The single variable is my first program and it does machine learning with one input variable.
The multiple variable is an upgrade to the first allowing for multiple input variables to effect the final result.

(In both programs the input is from a simple .txt file. They are simply the input and output of a function like 3x + 5 = y)
